TODO
====

* Add more development items on the agenda to the TODO file :)

* Refactor and abstract user placement logic into more flexible handler system which provides for different kinds of user placement conditional logic than just 'option menu selection' to user group content tree nodeID (one to one). Possible scenarios might include user placement based on many other factors, siteaccess, language, calculations based on multiple different kinds of user registration user input, etc.

* Refactor and abstract to support use of both ezselection and enhancedselection2 datatype since ezselection is very limited to use in practice

* Refactor settings and datatype content support to remove requirement that setting MoveToUserGroupId array content (nodeIDs) order exactly match selection datatype class option content


Implemented
