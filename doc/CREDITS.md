Primary extension development by Brookins Consulting

This solution was loosely based on the placeusers extension for eZ Publish 3, created by Tore Skobba: http://pubsvn.ez.no/community/trunk/extension/placeusers

Solution was later extended to provide additional features and eZ Publish 3.8+ compatibility by DB Informatics (Development by Kristof Coomans). http://projects.ez.no/index.php/automated_user_placement_for_ez_publish_3_8

The extension bcuserregisteruserplacement's workflow event was almost completely rewritten by Brookins Consulting to refactor the code standards, readability, functionality, comments and eZ Publish 4.x+ support.

The extension bcuserregisteruserplacement's settings where changed only as required in order to retain as much backwards compatibility as possible for existing users of the placeusers extension (for the initial release).

The placeusers extension copyright and license were retained in respect to the original author.
